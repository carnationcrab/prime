when changing directories you can use tab to autocomplete the folder name

pwd - print working directory: shows your current path

mkdir [name] - make directory

touch [file name] - creates a file

open . - opens a file (that was just created)


GIT

git init - initializes an empty repo in current directory

git status - shows things that are or are not being tracked for commits

git add . - this seems to be the same as git add --all, the period represents the current directory
